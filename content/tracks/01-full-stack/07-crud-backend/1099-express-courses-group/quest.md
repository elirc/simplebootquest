# Express: Counts per level

Add `GET /courses/by-level` returning an object mapping each `level` to how many courses have it.

The app, `express.json()` and the in-memory `courses` array are set up for you. Write real Express code: the tests call your app with Supertest-style `request(app)`, exactly like an integration test in a real project.

```js
// What the tests do:
const res = await request(app).get('/courses/by-level');
expect(res.status).toBe(…);
```
