# Password Policy #71: the workout app

The workout app's security team wants these password rules. Write `checkWorkoutPassword(pw, name)` returning an array of problem messages, **in this order**, for every rule the password breaks (an empty array if it's fine):

- at least 13 characters → `'too short'`
- an uppercase letter → `'needs an uppercase letter'`
- a symbol (anything that is not a letter, digit or space) → `'needs a symbol'`
- not contain the user's name (any case) → `'contains your name'`

Modern guidance (NIST 800-63B) favours **length** over complex composition rules, and checking against known-breached passwords. But you'll often have to implement whatever the policy says, precisely.
