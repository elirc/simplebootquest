# Deploy Drill: Is the cached copy fresh? #29

A response with `Cache-Control: max-age=N` is **fresh** for N seconds after it was generated (the `Age` header says how old a CDN copy already is). `no-cache` means "store it, but revalidate before every use", `no-store` means never store it, and `s-maxage` overrides `max-age` for shared caches (CDNs) only.
