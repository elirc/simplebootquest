# Test It: Paginate transactions

The **Code under test** tab has a correct `pageOfTransactions` and its dataset `TRANSACTIONS`. Write tests that pass against it **and** catch 2 hidden buggy versions (boundary mistakes, wrong rounding, mutated inputs…).

What the function does:

Return `{ items, page, totalPages }` where `items` are the references on page `page` (1-based) of size `size`. Out-of-range pages return an empty `items` array.

Tips: test the edges (an empty array, values exactly at a threshold, ties), not just one happy path. Use `toEqual` for arrays and objects.
