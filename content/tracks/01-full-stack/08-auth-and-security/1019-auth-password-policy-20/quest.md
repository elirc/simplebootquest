# Password Policy #20: the course app

The course app's security team wants these password rules. Write `checkCoursePassword(pw, name)` returning an array of problem messages, **in this order**, for every rule the password breaks (an empty array if it's fine):

- at least 9 characters → `'too short'`
- a digit → `'needs a digit'`
- an uppercase letter → `'needs an uppercase letter'`
- a lowercase letter → `'needs a lowercase letter'`
- no leading or trailing spaces → `'has surrounding spaces'`

Modern guidance (NIST 800-63B) favours **length** over complex composition rules, and checking against known-breached passwords. But you'll often have to implement whatever the policy says, precisely.
